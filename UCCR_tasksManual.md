# Creating manual tasks
{: #tasks_manual}

Typically, manual tasks represent some activity that is associated with a software release that has a start point, an end point, and a measurable duration.

Complete the following tasks to create a manual task:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **Manual**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task.

3. In the **Duration (minutes)** field, enter the number of minutes that you expect the task to run until it is completed. The estimated duration is used to calculate expected deployment times.

3. In the **Tags** list, attach a tag to the task. You can select multiple tags. To create a tag, type the tag name in list's text field.

3. In the **Assigned groups and users** list, assign the task to a user or group. The assigned user runs the task during deployment.

3. In the **Owner** list, select the task owner. The default owner is the user who created the task. The **Owner** list is displayed after the task is assigned to a user or group.    

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.
