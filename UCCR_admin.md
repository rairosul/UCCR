Functional security
{:shortdesc}

Users are authenticated to Bluemix with their IBM web identity. For Bluemix Dedicated and Local, LDAP authentication is supported by default. [Overview of Bluemix security services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/security/index.html)

In {{site.data.keyword.uccr_short}}, you use organizations to enable collaboration among users and to facilitate the logical grouping of project resources. User security is managed on the Bluemix organization level.

You can group a set of spaces, applications, services, domains, routes, and users together in organizations.
You can manage the access to the spaces and organizations on a per-user basis.
When you create an organization, the organization name must be unique in Bluemix. If the organization name is already in use by another Bluemix Public, Dedicated, or Local user, then you must specify a new name. After you create the organization, you will be automatically assigned the Organization Manager permission, which enables you to edit the organization name, add users, and create or delete spaces in the organization.

Domains

Spaces

Within an organization, you can use spaces to group a set of applications, services, and users. Spaces are tied to a specific region in Bluemix.

After you add users to an organization, you can grant them permissions to the spaces. Similar to organizations, spaces also have a set of user roles with specific permissions that are assigned to team members:

admins
control the security system and UCD protected environments. No UCD protected environments can be used until a user is added to UCD admin role for the protected resource (effetcs UCD only, not Bluemix).

Control is on the org level--org manager. Can see users in the org. If the org admin is admin in more than pone org, he can include users from all his orgs.
