# Creating header tasks
{: #tasks_header}

Header tasks represent organization elements that you can add to deployment plans. If you create a task group, you might identify the group with a header task. Header tasks can have dependencies like any other task.

When you import a deployment plan from IBM UrbanCode Release, segment tasks are bracketed by note-type Start Segment and End Segment tasks. Segment dependencies are represented by dependencies to End Segment tasks.

To create a header task, complete the following steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **Header**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task. The name might represent a task group name.

3. In the **Description** field, enter or paste a description. You might enter a note, a reminder, or other instructions in the field.

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.
